            <h2>I'm Demi van Run</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently still a student at Zuyd Hogeschool located in The Netherlands. I'm now in America having
                the opportunity to study here as part of my education in The Netherlands. It is the greatest experience
                I can imagine. I love the people I’m meeting here. I’m studying to be a designer, but I want to
                specialize in AR/VR. It would be so great to make it more accessible to more places. And to make things
                for it, would be a crazy good opportunity to do that.
            </p>
            <h3>The things I want to do in my next job would be:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Making video's</li>
                <li>Making picturse</li>
                <li>Editing the video</li>
                <li>Making escape rooms in real life or in the Virtual Reality glasses</li>
                <li>Making things for in the Virtual Reality glasses</li>
                <li>Making augmented reality possible in theater</li>
            </ul>
