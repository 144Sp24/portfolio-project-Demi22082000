                        <h4>VR Escaperooms</h4>
                        <p>
                            I've made some escaperooms in the VR. I've done this for a school in the Netherlands so that
                            the students can learn in a fun way. This was part of my internship.

                        <h4>Making a multimedia story</h4>
                        <p>
                            In Cooperation with the CBS I've worked in a group to make this story about 2 brothers in
                            the farming industry. This to show the difference between normal farming and biological
                            farming.

                        <h4>A museum concept</h4>
                        <p>
                            We worked in groups on this project. We started with the question of how we can make this
                            museum more appealing to the public. We have figured out that interaction would create
                            curiosity and making people more interested in the content. We’ve done this true giving the
                            public the choice of which story they want to hear, through pushing buttons. The buttons
                            will activate a hologram with the story outspoken.

                        <p>
                            For my internship I’ve made video’s and so much more. The video’s were meant to explain
                            which kind of directions of school you can choose. I also made some other video’s. I was
                            also busy with making some logo’s and icons for them to use.

                    <p>
                        We have practically investigated how STEAM education can be delivered using VR. We have shared
                        the experience in a multimedia product. We have created a digital exhibition where visitors can
                        see the works of the children.

                        Integrating interactive exhibits, historical reenactments, and immersive storytelling, the event
                        aims to engage and educate attendees, fostering a deeper connection with the city's cultural
                        heritage. An exploration of Maastricht's past through a dynamic and entertaining festival

                    <p>
                        My internship was the best time, i've learned so much. More then i ever did in school. I learned
                        working together. The fun part in this internship was that I was the first intern in many years.
                        I found my love for making new things that aren't existing yet.
